  <p style="color:black;">
      
      

      The Composition API consists of a number of different Vue.js internals exposed via utility functions. 
      It helps to better organize component code by logical concern and makes it easier to separate component logic from the component 
      template and even reuse that logic across multiple components. Finally, it brings better Typescript support to Vue.js. </p>
