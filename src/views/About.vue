    <p style="color:black;">
        Vuetify complies with the Material Design specification, meaning the core features of both Vue and Material are 
        available by default and can be improved upon by both communities. In addition, Vuetify offers the following features:
        

<br>
       Compatibility with Vue CLI-3 and RTL
Templates for various frameworks, like Cordova, webpack, etc.
Internationalization
SSR and PWA </p>
<hr>

<p style="color:black;">Using Vuetify means you have to embrace Material Design. Therefore, 
    apps intended for the iOS universe are not good candidates for Vuetify. Likewise, if you need a custom design in regards to style as a whole, Vuetify may not suit you, either. 
    As always, you ll still need to perform a prior, deeper analysis of your project s needs.</p>
